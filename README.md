# Closet
Closet is a modern Lisp-based programming language for code generation and automation.

Unlike general-purpose programming languages, Closet has a very specialized use case: generating and running code in *other* languages, while writing as little code as possible.

For more details, check out [antilisp.com](https://antilisp.com). This was the website of Closet before it was made open source, under a different name.

The new website is hosted at [closet-lang.org](https://closet-lang.org). Currently, this website only contains the documentation generated from this repository.
