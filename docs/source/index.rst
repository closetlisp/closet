Closet documentation
====================


Closet is modern Lisp-based language for scripted code generation. It can generate, process, build and run code in any other language.


This documentation covers the syntax and builtins of Closet.
It serves as both a tutorial and an updated reference of the core semantics and builtins, with specialized entries to cover specific uses of Closet.
As the tooling improves, this documentation will include more detailed tutorials and examples of using Closet for code generation.


Note: Closet is the new name of the `Antilisp programming language`_. While the source code and documentation are being made open source, the downloads and documentation can also be found on the Antilisp website.
