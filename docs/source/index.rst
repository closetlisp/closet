Closet documentation
====================

Closet is a Lisp-based programming language focused on automating code generation.
Typically, Closet should almost never be used on its own. Instead, it is used to generate, process and run programs in other languages.

This documentation covers the syntax and builtins of Closet.
It serves as both a tutorial and an updated reference of the core semantics and builtins, with specialized entries to cover specific uses of Closet.
As the tooling improves, this documentation will include more detailed tutorials and examples of using Closet for code generation.


Note: Closet is the new name of the `Antilisp programming language`_. While the source code and documentation are being made open source, the downloads and documentation can also be found on the Antilisp website.
